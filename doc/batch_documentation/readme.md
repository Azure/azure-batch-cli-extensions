* [Input data references using linked storage accounts](inputFiles.md#referencing-input-data)
* [Automatic persistence of task output files to Azure Storage](outputFiles.md)
* [Job and pool templates with parameterization](templates.md)
* [Task factories for automatic task generation on job submission](taskFactories.md)
* [Container-based workflows through integration with Batch Shipyard (Docker)](shipyard.md)
* [Split job configuration and management with reusable application templates](application-templates.md)
* [Easy software installation via package managers](packages.md)
