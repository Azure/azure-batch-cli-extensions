    All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.

    :param subnet_id: Required. The ARM resource identifier of the virtual
     network subnet which Compute Nodes running Tasks from the Job will join
     for the duration of the Task. This will only work with a
     VirtualMachineConfiguration Pool. The virtual network must be in the same
     region and subscription as the Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet
     should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of Compute
     Nodes which will run Tasks from the Job. This can be up to the number of
     Compute Nodes in the Pool. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
     must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
     Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet so that Azure Batch service can
     schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
     specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If
     communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG,
     then the Batch service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to
     unusable. This is of the form
     /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
     If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG),
     then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication
     from the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a Virtual Machine
     configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux
     and port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also required to be open for
     outbound connections for communications to Azure Storage. For more details
