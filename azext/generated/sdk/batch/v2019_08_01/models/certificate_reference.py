    All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.

    :param thumbprint: Required. The thumbprint of the Certificate.
    :type thumbprint: str
    :param thumbprint_algorithm: Required. The algorithm with which the
     thumbprint is associated. This must be sha1.
    :type thumbprint_algorithm: str
    :param store_location: The location of the Certificate store on the
     Compute Node into which to install the Certificate. The default value is
     currentuser. This property is applicable only for Pools configured with
     Windows Compute Nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or
     with virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows Image reference). For
     Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside the
     Task working directory and an environment variable
     AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this
     location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
     directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
     /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that directory.
     Possible values include: 'currentUser', 'localMachine'
    :type store_location: str or ~azure.batch.models.CertificateStoreLocation
    :param store_name: The name of the Certificate store on the Compute Node
     into which to install the Certificate. This property is applicable only
     for Pools configured with Windows Compute Nodes (that is, created with
     cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using a
     Windows Image reference). Common store names include: My, Root, CA, Trust,
     Disallowed, TrustedPeople, TrustedPublisher, AuthRoot, AddressBook, but
     any custom store name can also be used. The default value is My.
    :type store_name: str
    :param visibility: Which user Accounts on the Compute Node should have
     access to the private data of the Certificate. You can specify more than
     one visibility in this collection. The default is all Accounts.
    :type visibility: list[str or ~azure.batch.models.CertificateVisibility]
